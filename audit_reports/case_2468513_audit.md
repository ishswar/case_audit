## Quality Ratings

| Category | Rating | Description |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| Initial Response | 3/5 | The initial response was relatively quick, but it could have been more tailored to the specific issue reported instead of a generic request for information. It also would have been better to provide some initial troubleshooting steps or suggestions based on the description. |
| Problem Diagnosis | 3/5 | The problem diagnosis focused on the EAR file creation process and the inclusion of shared modules, which was a good starting point. However, it took several back-and- forths to pinpoint this as the actual issue. More proactive analysis of the provided logs initially could have sped up the process. |
| Technical Accuracy | 4/5 | The technical analysis regarding the missing shared modules in the EAR file was accurate and relevant to the problem. The support engineer correctly identified this discrepancy by comparing working and non-working EAR files. |
| Solution Quality | 4/5 | The solution, which involved re-mavenizing the application and shared modules, was effective in resolving the issue. While the client found the solution themselves, the suggestions from the support engineer were helpful in guiding them towards this resolution. The support engineer did not provide the solution directly but helped by asking the right questions. |
| Communication | 3/5 | Communication was consistent, but there were delays at times. The support engineer did make an effort to schedule calls to discuss the issue, but the communication could have been more proactive with updates and suggestions while waiting for customer responses. Also, the automatic 'pending customer response' updates without a clear next step are not very helpful. |
| Overall Experience | 3/5 | Overall, this was a decent support case that was resolved relatively quickly. However, improvements could be made in the initial response, proactive communication, and providing more specific troubleshooting steps. The case was resolved by the customer, but the support engineer was helpful in guiding them. |


## Detailed Feedback

to the specific issue reported instead of a generic request for information. It
also would have been better to provide some initial troubleshooting steps or
suggestions based on the description.

### Problem Diagnosis

updates without a clear next step are not very helpful.

### Overall Assessment

Overall, this was a decent support case that was resolved relatively quickly.
However, improvements could be made in the initial response, proactive
communication, and providing more specific troubleshooting steps. The case was
resolved by the customer, but the support engineer was helpful in guiding them.


## Recommendations

1. Improve the initial response by including specific troubleshooting steps related to deployment issues and impaired states in Kubernetes
2. Be more proactive in analyzing logs and providing targeted suggestions, rather than simply requesting more information
3. Provide clearer and more detailed instructions for gathering information, such as specific commands to run in the Kubernetes environment
4. Include links to relevant documentation about BWCE deployment and troubleshooting in Azure/Kubernetes
5. After identifying the missing modules in the EAR, give specific direction on how to generate a new EAR with the modules
