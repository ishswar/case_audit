        Please evaluate the quality of support for this TIBCO support case. 
        Analyze the case content below from a quality assurance perspective, focus on:

        1. Initial Response - How timely and effective was the initial response?
        2. Problem Diagnosis - How effective was the approach to diagnosing the issue?
        3. Technical Accuracy - How accurate and relevant was the technical guidance provided?
        4. Solution Quality - How effective was the solution provided?
        5. Communication - How clear, professional, and timely was the communication?
        6. Overall Experience - How would you rate the customer's overall experience?

        Rate each category from 1-5 (5 being best), and provide brief feedback for each category.
        Also provide an overall assessment and list 3-5 specific recommendations for improvement.

        Format your recommendations as a numbered list and make them specific and actionable.
        For example:
        1. Be more proactive in follow-ups
        2. Document steps taken in more detail
        3. Include specific steps for the customer to troubleshoot
        4. Escalate to engineering sooner when initial efforts aren't working
        5. Provide documentation links with each response

        Format your analysis as valid JSON like this:

          "ratings": {{
            "initial_response": 3,
